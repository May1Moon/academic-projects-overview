# Text-Based Social Media Application (C)
Academic project completed as part of SYSC 2006 – Foundations of Imperative Programming

## Overview:
This project is a text-based social media application implemented in C.
The program runs in a terminal environment and models basic social media
functionality using dynamic data structures. 

## Features:

- User creation with unique password enforcement
- Password updates with old-password verification
- Adding and deleting posts using a stack-based data structure
- Managing a user friends list using an alphabetically sorted stack
- Viewing a user’s catalogue of posts via username search

## Technical Focus:

- Implemented core logic in C using dynamically allocated data structures
- Stack-based and linked data structure manipulation
- Menu-driven control flow using console input
- Manual memory allocation and deallocation

## Additional Notes:
The full implementation will be kept in private repositories to comply with university academic
integrity policies.
