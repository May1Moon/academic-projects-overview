# Text-Based Social Media Application (C)
Academic project completed as part of SYSC 2006 – Foundations of Imperative Programming

# Overview:
This project is a text-based social media application implemented in C.
The program runs in a terminal environment and models basic social media
functionality using dynamic data structures.

# Contributions:
- Implemented the majority of the program logic in C
- Worked with a small amount of instructor-provided starter code
- Designed and manipulated linked data structures such as stacks (sorting, adding, removing)
- Implemented menu-driven flow using user input
- Managed dynamic memory allocation and deallocation

# Additional Notes:
The full implementation will be kept in private repositories to comply with university academic
integrity policies.
