# Project Performance Tracker (C)

Academic project completed as part of SYSC2006 – Foundations of Imperative Programming

## Overview

This project is a terminal-based C application for tracking project performance across milestones and activities.

The program reads planned activity durations from a file, initializes project, milestone, and activity data, and allows users to update actual durations and completion status through a console-based menu. As updates are made, the program recalculates actual cost, schedule, and completion state at both the milestone and project level, reporting whether milestones and the overall project are over or under budget and early or late.

## Technical Focus

- Dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation
- Struct-based data representation for project, milestone, and activity state
- Manual memory allocation and deallocation
- Used file I/O for data initialization
- Menu-driven control flow using functions, loops, and conditionals
- Updated cost, schedule calculations, and completion state based on user input

## Additional Notes

The full implementation is kept private to comply with university academic integrity policies.
