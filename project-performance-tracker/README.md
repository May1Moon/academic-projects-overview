# Project Performance Tracker (C)

Academic project completed as part of SYSC2006 – Foundations of Imperative Programming

## Overview

This project is a terminal-based project management and performance tracking application written in C.

The program models a project composed of milestones and activities and compares planned vs. actual cost and duration using file-based initialization and with interactive updates on project stats including status of completion.

## Contributions

- Dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation
- Struct-based data representation for project, milestone, and activity state
- Used file I/O for data initialization
- Menu-driven control flow using functions, loops, and conditionals
- Updated cost, schedule calculations, and completion state based on user input

## Additional Notes
The full implementation is kept private to comply with university academic integrity policies.
